Rules Of Hangman:
1. The game starts with a hidden word, where each letter is represented by a blank space or underscore symbol.

2. The player can choose to guess a letter by clicking on a letter button displayed on the screen.

3. If the guessed letter is present in the hidden word, all instances of that letter will be revealed in their respective positions. The player's score or chances are not affected in this case.

4. If the guessed letter is not present in the hidden word, the player's score or chances are decreased by one. The incorrect guess is recorded or displayed on the screen, such as drawing part of a hangman diagram.

5. The player's score or chances are limited to a fixed number, such as 6. If the player exhausts all the chances, they lose the game.

6. The player wins the game if they successfully guess all the letters in the hidden word before running out of chances.

7. The player cannot guess the same letter again if it has already been guessed correctly or incorrectly.

8. The player can choose to restart the game at any time, resetting the hidden word, score, and guesses.

9. The hidden word is typically chosen randomly from a predefined list of words to keep the game unpredictable and exciting.

10. The game can display additional information, such as the number of letters in the hidden word, the score, remaining chances, and the correctly or incorrectly guessed letters, to assist the player in making educated guesses.
